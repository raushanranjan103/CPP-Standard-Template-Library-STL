Problem Name: Circular Merging
Problem Difficulty: None
Problem Constraints: 2 ≤ N ≤ 400 
1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 for each valid i
Problem Description:
N integers A1,A2,…,AN are placed in a circle in such a way that for each valid i, Ai and Ai+1 are adjacent, and A1 and AN are also adjacent.

We want to repeat the following operation exactly N−1 times (until only one number remains):

:- Select two adjacent numbers. Let's denote them by a and b.
:- Score a+b penalty points.
:- Erase both a and b from the circle and insert a+b in the space between them.

What is the minimum number of penalty points we can score?

Input Format: The first line contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
Sample Input: 
3
10 10 1
Output Format: Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of penalty points.
Sample Output: 32
